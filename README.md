# Next.js Login Example

This project is a minimal **Next.js (App Router)** app with:

- A `/login` page with a styled login form
- A `/dashboard` page that acts as the "home" after login
- A redirect from `/` to `/login`

> Note: This project was scaffolded without running `create-next-app`, so you need **Node.js and npm** installed to run it.

## Prerequisites

- Install **Node.js LTS** (which includes npm) from the official website: `https://nodejs.org/`

After installing, restart your terminal and run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Both commands should print versions (no "not recognized" errors).

## Install dependencies

From the project root (`C:\\Users\\abhin\\Desktop\\test1`), run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download `next`, `react`, `react-dom`, TypeScript, and ESLint.

## Run the dev server

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

- You will be redirected from `/` to `/login`
- Use these **demo credentials**:
  - Email: `test@example.com`
  - Password: `password`

On successful login you will be navigated to `/dashboard`.
